Getting Code for Single Page Application
As I said in the previous video, first we will integrate Express framework into a Single Page Application. We will use code from Section 5 as a starting point. You can get this code from the Github repository. Just follow 3 easy steps:

1. First, you need to clone this repository to your computer.

    git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial.git
    cd webpack-tutorial

2. Then checkout the branch integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application.

    git checkout -b integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application remotes/origin/integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application

3. Finally, don't forget to reinstall project dependencies after switching to the new branch.

    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    At this point you have all the files you need in order to integrate Express framework into a Single Page Application.



    Getting Code for Multiple Page Application
In the next video we will integrate Express framework into a Multiple Page Application. We will use code from Section 6 as a starting point. You can get this code from the Github repository. Just follow 3 easy steps:

1. First, you need to clone this repository to your computer.

git clone https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial.git
cd webpack-tutorial
2. Then checkout the branch integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application.

git checkout -b integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application remotes/origin/integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application
3. Finally, don't forget to reinstall project dependencies after switching to the new branch.

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
At this point you have all the files you need in order to integrate Express framework into a Multiple Page Application.
